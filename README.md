- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeviLingsch
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of machine learning for physical systems, and spectral transformation. This intersection is especially prevalent with current research in the field of Neural Operator Learning, and in particular the Fourier Neural Operator. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computational Science and Engineering in Zurich, Switzerland. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on far fetched ideas which probably won't work, but we can learn a lot from.
- 📫 Reach me through email at levi.lingsch@sam.math.ethz.ch
