- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeviLingsch
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of engineering, finance, and computing for sustainable business models. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computational Science and Engineering in Zurich, Switzerland. 
- 🌱 I'm working to enhance the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators at the ETH Soft Robotics Lab.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on far fetched ideas which probably won't work, but we can learn a lot from.
- 📫 Reach me through email at levi.lingsch@srl.ethz.ch.
